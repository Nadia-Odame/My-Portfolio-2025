        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><strong>Nadia Akua Nsiah Odame</strong> is a passionate <strong>Software Engineering student at ALCHE University in Mauritius</strong>, originally from Ghana. She’s driven by a vision to use technology as a force for empowerment and inclusion especially for <strong>women and differently-abled learners</strong>.</p>
        <p>Her journey began with curiosity about how systems work, which grew into a calling to create impactful digital solutions. Today, she’s developing her skills in <strong>Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Linux, and Machine Learning</strong>, with a strong focus on using AI to solve real-world problems.</p>
        <p>Before diving into software engineering, Nadia gained hands-on experience in <strong>electrical and mechanical engineering</strong> under the mentorship of <strong>Mr. Anthony</strong> at <strong>Smart and Wise Technical Services</strong>; an experience that shaped her understanding of how hardware and software connect.</p>
        <p>She has also shown strong leadership as a <strong>Project Manager</strong> in the <strong>ALX Pathway program</strong>, where she led her team in projects like community cleanups and environmental documentaries. Nadia later co-created <strong>LearnPod</strong>, an app supporting deaf and blind learners, and contributed to <strong>AfriX</strong>, a think tank developing tech-driven African solutions.</p>
        <p>Her goal is to become a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong>, building intelligent systems that make life better for others. Beyond her studies, she enjoys sharing ideas, creating, and playing <strong>Among Us</strong>, which mirrors her love for teamwork and problem-solving.</p>
        <p>💡 She believes technology isn’t just about coding, it’s about creating impact.</p>
