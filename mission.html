        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p>I believe in empowering women and girls to access <strong>STEM education</strong> and use technology to make meaningful change.</p>
        <p>Globally, women are significantly <strong>underrepresented</strong> in STEM fields due to barriers in education, mentorship, and resources.I am committed to bridging this gap and creating opportunities where talent and potential are not limited by gender.</p>
        <p><em>I am driven</em> by the belief that women and girls deserve equal opportunities in STEM. My aim is to empower them by increasing access, confidence, and representation in technology and science. By creating inclusive learning platforms, mentorship initiatives, and community-driven projects, I provide the tools and guidance necessary for women to succeed. Within my journey at ALCHE, I am committed to translating this mission into real impact that fosters growth, innovation, and equity.</p>

        <h1>My Vision</h1>
        <p>I envision a world where innovation and technology are inclusive and <strong>accessible</strong> to everyone, especially women and girls. My goal is to build a future where barriers in STEM education are removed, and every learner has the opportunity to explore, create, and innovate. Through ongoing projects and initiatives, I aim to cultivate a culture of empowerment, collaboration, and learning that supports lasting societal change.</p>

        <h2>Global Challenge & Opportunity</h2>
        <p>Around the world, <strong>women</strong> remain significantly underrepresented in STEM due to educational gaps, societal biases, and lack of mentorship opportunities. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity: by addressing these gaps, we can empower women and girls to pursue STEM careers and contribute meaningfully to innovation. Through projects like LearnPod (inclusive tech for differently-abled learners) and AfriX (community-driven STEM initiatives), I am creating pathways that increase access, skills, and confidence among women in technology and education.</p>
